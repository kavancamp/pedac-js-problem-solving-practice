PEDAC

- UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
  - Read the problem description
  - Identify inputs/outputs
  - Identify rules/requirements
  - ask clarifying questions
  - examine all examples
- EXAMPLES/TEST CASES
  - understand how the input translates to output
  - identify edge cases
    - Can my program handle 0s or empty arrays?
- DATA STRUCTURES
  - what kind of data are you primarily dealing with?
    - strings arrays numbers objects etc
    - this helps focus on methods
- ALGORITHM
  - step by step process that takes you from input to output
  - handles edge cases and valid example inputs
  - your code will depend on your algorithm
- CODE
  - time to write the code
  - use everything youve gathered in your pedac to write the code
- DEBUG (if needed)
  -carefully review algorithm before looking at your code
- once issue is identified, change algorithm first then fix code
